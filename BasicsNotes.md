# Python:
&nbsp; Python is a general purpose interpruted language which is famous for its libraries and simplified syntax. It is developed by Gudio von Rossum in the year 1991 and it is maintained by Python Development Foundation. Python is used in web development, game development, AI, machine learning, data science, scientific computing. Python supports procedural, functional and class type of programming. 

# Features of Python:
* Python is a case sensitive language where upper case and lower case are treated differently. 
* Python supports OOP where we can write code using classes and object.
* Python is not perfectly a OOP language because does not support Overloading. 
* Python is functional programming language where it supports function to write code.
* Python is procedural programming language where we don't need function or class to write code. 
* Python is a dynamically typed language where we don't need mentioning the data type.
* Python is a interpreted Language where code is executed line by line.  
* Python is platform independent. 
* Python is a scripting language. 

# Memory Management in Python:
&nbsp; Python manages the memory very efficiently. Python will not allows any duplicate variable. If there is any duplicate variable declared the old value will be replaced by new variable and old variable go to garbage collector. Especially for integer, when same integer is declared in two different variable then two different variable points to same memory location. By this python memory management creates a robust and efficient environment to work with.
